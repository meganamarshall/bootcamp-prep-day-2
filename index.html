    <h1>A Couple of Place Holders</h1>

    <p>
        Our conscience cannot rest so long as nearly 45 million Americans don't have health insurance and the millions more who do are going bankrupt trying to pay for it. That's what compromise is about. But they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation. I have made it clear to the Iraqi people that we pursue no bases, and no claim on their territory or resources.
    </p>

    <p>But <strong>what type</strong> of place holders might we encounter?</p>

    <ol>
        <li class="holder-type">Text (content place holders like Lorem Ipsum</li>
        <li class="holder-type">Image place holders</li>
    </ol>
